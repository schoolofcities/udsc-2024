    "Of course, we can always just map these two variables individually. However, overlaying them onto a single map can be incredibly useful for highlighting areas of correlation (or lack thereof) at different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the bivariate map above, we can quickly identify areas with greater material deprivation but a lack of cycling infrastructure (in pink). These neighborhoods arguably should be at the top of the list for new investments in cycling infrastructure. The dark purple areas are those with high material deprivation but good cycling infrastructure, while the green areas are wealthier areas with good cycling infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of maps can aid effective spatial storytelling and communication of findings, highlighting specific local areas of need, and be a useful exploratory analysis step before more sophisticated spatial modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to cover how to create bivariate choropleth maps like these using [Python](https://www.python.org/) (mostly using [geoPandas](https://geopandas.org/)), with some final touch-ups and legend design in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and QGIS. The example data will be on urban health-related data in Canada (replicating the map above), but the methods and code can be applied to anywhere with two quantitative variables linked to the same set of geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a short side note on history, it is surprising that despite centuries of thematic maps showing multivariate data, bivariate choropleths are a recent creation. They gained popularity in the 1970s via maps created by the U.S. Bureau of the Census ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1559/152304075784313250)). Here's one of their maps. I believe these were the first published bivariate maps, but if you are reading this and know of earlier bivariate maps, please let me know. I'd be super interested to see them."

    "A noted drawback with bivariate maps is that they are often not initially intuitive and sometimes require a good amount of looking back-and-forth with the legend, especially compared to univariate choropleth maps. Even with a 3x3 legend like the map above, it can take a bit of time to read the map and understand and parse out specific values (especially for the middle values). If you're more interested in understanding each variable on its own, rather than a direct comparison, it's probably best to stick with two side-by-side univariate choropleth maps. If you want to allow for comparison but keep things easier to read, a 2x2 legend might be better, but remember that different aggregation can lead to varying results!"
